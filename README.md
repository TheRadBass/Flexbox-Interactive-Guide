# Flexbox Interactive Guide

This flexbox guide is inspired on the [CSS's Tricks's Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/), and has been created as an interactive example of what I've been learned there.

## Approach

The guide follows very closely what's covered in the CSS Tricks's guide, showing the theory first, and then some interactive examples to give deeper visual aid in hopes of achieving a better understanding of the Flexbox module.


## Do you see something that could be improved?
I created this interactive guide as part of my studies with the purpose of getting a little practice with flexbox, so I'm sure there will be some errors or areas of opportunity. If you catch anything that could improve the guide and help others learn better let me know, pull requests are welcome.
